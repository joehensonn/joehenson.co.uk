Codebase for my personal website which is built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), a React-based framework for building static sites.

Gatsby's a great tool for building super fast sites, and granted my site doesn't have a whole load of content, run a lighthouse report and look at those stats 😉

The site also references [me as an API](https://github.com/joehensonn/me).

**Installation/Setup**

1. Install Gatsby CLI tool via Brew or NPM
2. `npm install`
3. `gatsby develop`

**Deployment**

Netlify automatically builds & deploys when pushed to master on GitHub.
